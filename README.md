Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with. the design,development, testing and maintenance of software applications.
software engineering help in developing tailored software solutions,streaming processes and helps in businesses to manage data efficiently  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968:the first NATO software engineering conference 
1970s:A number of new methodologies are developed
1982:the first computer aided software engineering tools are released.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
project planning
gathering requirements and analysis
design 
coding
testing 
deployment maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall requires the team to complete each project. phase before moving to the next one while agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer inputs the codes,quality assurance engineer checks the quality of the code while project manager oversee the whole project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE increases developer productivity 
IDE helps programmers develop software code efficiently. 
VCS streamline development processes
VCS enables faster iteration and delivery of features  


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

challenges are;
rapid advancement of technology
time. limitation 
limited resources 
undefined system boundaries

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

integration tests
functional tests
end to end tests
acceptance testing

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

is the process of refining prompts that a person can input into a generative AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"how should I make photos look amazing?".
it should be "I want to make my photos look more clear and sharp,please recommend some good websites of making photos look good"
